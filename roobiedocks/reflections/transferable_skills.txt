I have several years experience in C++ and Python and some experience in bash scripts. I also have used Ubuntu and Fedora Linux before and I am familiar with the command line which I think will help me a lot with this class. So my main transferable skills that will help me with ruby are my prior linux experience and my work as a programmer in C++ and Python.
